# Data::Hopen - A dataflow library with first-class edges

[![Appveyor Status](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/cxw42/data-hopen.svg?logo=appveyor)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/cxs42/data-hopen)



`Data::Hopen` is a dataflow library that runs actions you specify, moves data
between those actions, and permits transforming data as the data moves.  It is
the underlying engine of the [App::hopen](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3Ahopen) cross-platform software build
generator, but can be used for any dataflow task that can be represented as a
directed acyclic graph (DAG).

# INSTALLATION

Easiest: install `cpanminus` if you don't have it - see
[https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::cpanminus#INSTALLATION).  Then run
`cpanm Data::Hopen`.

Manually: clone or untar into a working directory.  Then, in that directory,

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

(you may need to install dependencies as well -
see [https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html](https://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html) for resources).
If all the tests pass,

    make install

If some of the tests fail, please check the issues and file a new one if
no one else has reported the problem yet.
